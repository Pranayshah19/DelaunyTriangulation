# DelaunyTriangulation
Delaunay Triangulation is a geometric method that divides a set of points into triangles where no point lies within the circumcircle of any triangle. This approach ensures optimal triangle shapes, enhancing stability and accuracy in applications like computer graphics and path planning.
